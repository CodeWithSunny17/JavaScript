// Note: this topic can be better explained in React

// Debouncing: Debouncing is a technique in programming that helps improve the performance of web applications by controlling the frequency at which time-consuming tasks are triggered. 
// If a task is triggered too often—like when a user types quickly or rapidly clicks a button—it can lead to performance issues. 
// Debouncing provides a solution by limiting how frequently a function can be executed.


// Throattling: Throttling is a technique used to limit the number of times a function can be executed in a given time frame. 
// It’s extremely useful when dealing with performance-heavy operations, such as resizing the window or scrolling events, where repeated triggers can lead to performance issues.
